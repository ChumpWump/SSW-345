Index.js should have everything
this goes for the index.js in the server file aswell
I would've uploaded everything that was in the original file, however it gave me complications with some files. I dont know if these are entirely necessary for grading or
testing but the ones that wouldnt upload are: .eslintrc.json .gitignore.txt and .travis.yml
